## Purpose / Business Case
Reduce outages and deployment risk by moving IndoorApp from on-prem monolith to containerized services with a defined DR posture, simulated on free local cloud emulators.

---

## Objectives (SMART)
- Containerize Web/API/DB and baseline design by Week 1.  
- CI/CD blueprint and rollback procedure by Week 2.  
- UAT + Blue/Green go-live simulation by Week 3.

---

## Milestones
- Charter & Case Study approved — Week 0  
- Design baselined — Week 1  
- Build/Test complete — Week 2  
- Go-Live simulation & Closure — Week 3

---

## Success Criteria
- All critical UAT cases pass.  
- DR tabletop with ≤ 60 min rollback (simulated).  
- Sign-off on go-live checklist.

---

## Constraints & Assumptions
- Only free tools/emulators.  
- No production data; screenshots/logs accepted as evidence.

---

## High-Level Risks
- Tooling learning curve → mitigated via concise how-to and scope control.  
- Scope creep → controlled by change log and baseline.
